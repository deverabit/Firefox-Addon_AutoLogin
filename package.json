Click it to open a new page where you can enter your username and password which will be saved on your computer. After that has been entered, UCLA login pages will be automatically completed for you effortlessly. If you don&#39;t see it, try using Ctrl+&#39;/&#39; to open the add-ons toolbar.\n\nTo stop the automatic login (possibly to let someone else use your computer), simply click the menu button on the top-left corner, find and click Add-ons, then find the UCLA Add-on and click disable. It can then be re-enabled from the same menu.", "contributors": [], "author": "bday106", "url": "", "dependencies": ["api-utils", "addon-kit"], "version": "1.2", "lib": "lib", "fullName": "UCLA Automated Login", "main": "main", "id": "jid0-XAdQ8JZBK8BMGzsmthgurtI6Mac", "name": "ucla-automated-login"}
